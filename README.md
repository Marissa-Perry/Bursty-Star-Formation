* *Ongoing* project at the University of Texas at Austin within the Galaxy Evolution Vertically Integrated Project (GEVIP) research group !
* I'm measuring the burstiness of ~130 galaxies at $z \leq 7$ using JWST NIRSpec data.
* This project is motivated by recent work on the potential stochasticity of star formation in the early universe (Shen-2023; Ciesla-2024).
* To measure the burstiness of a given galaxy, I'm comparing the timescale of star formation events—traced by the ratio of hydrogen recombination (e.g., $H\alpha$) emission and UV continuum emission—to the relative star formation rate—the residual $H\alpha$ emission from the apparent star forming main sequence curve.

## Presented Work at UT Austin's Dept. of Astronomy Undergraduate Research Forum (April, 2024)
